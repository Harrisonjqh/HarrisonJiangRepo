  <p style="font-size:25pt;">What is vaporwave?</p><!-- This is my subtitle-->
  <p style="color:#ff0070;font-size:20pt;">Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.The style is defined by its borrowing of 1980s and 1990s mood music styles such as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects. Its surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.</p><!-- This is what I found online-->
